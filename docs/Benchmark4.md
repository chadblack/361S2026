# Benchmark Assignment 4: Write like a (Weird) Historian. 

**DUE: MAY 10** 


For our final benchmark, students will analyze a film from Latin America through the theoretical and historical lens that we have developed this semester. The best papers will chose films that are not strictly historical, and identify within them the historical work of the social formation capital-nation-state. This is a challenging task, and we're not looking exactly for traditional film criticism or for the type of "historical critique" that tires to identify the authentic and inauthentic in the film. 

What pasts does the film recruit into the present? What implicit or explicit claims does it make as to the meaning of nation, state, and capital within the frame of its national cinema? Return to the opening weeks of the semester, and see if you can identify those theoretical threads at work in the film. There are many, many films that will qualify. So, you will pick your film in consultation with Dr. Black no later than March 31st. We will likewise chose three readings to go with the film. You will be limited to those readings and the film in your analysis. 

Use prose, with paragraphs, as if in a traditional essay.  

* Include a word count. Your assignment should be between 1500 and 2000 words.  
* Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs.  
* Information should be presented as a coherent whole.  
* Include at least 3 quotes that illustrate your point.  
* Use footnotes for the three quotes and for any other idea or paraphrase you're referencing from the text. Footnote quotes immediate. Other information can be noted at the end of its paragraph. Use [The Chicago Manual of Style citation guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).  Film citations should include the time stamps of scenes or lines.
