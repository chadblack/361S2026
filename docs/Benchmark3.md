# Benchmark Assignment 3: Where'd that come from?

**DUE: April 17**

Historians work with an enormous variety of information, integrating people, events, broad patterns, theoretical arguments, and more. In this assignment, you will work backwards from a finished piece of historical work to recreate the difficult syntheses at the root of historical research. 

For this assignment, each student will choose one article from the *HAHR*, *The Americas*, or *The Latin Americanist* that is on a topic related to this semester. You will take a deep dive into their footnotes/endnotes/citations.

1. To start, you will write a précis and research memo for the chapter or article, identifying its primary purpose and overall structure. If it's part of a book, what is its purpose for the overall book?
2. Create a categorized bibliography of every source cited in the piece. You may choose your own categorization-- thematic, temporal, primary/secondary, etc. Explain why you divided the sources up the way that you did. 
3. See if you can locate copies of any of the sources. Very old books can often be found on [archive.org](https://archive.org),  [hathitrust.org](https://hathitrust.org), or [books.google.com](https://books.google.com). Other books or articles may be in our own library's collections. Primary sources from Spanish or Latin American Archives may be in digital collections of those archives-- it's hard to say. 
4. Pick a few of those sources and read through or interact with them. Compare your own experience with them to how they're used in your article/chapter. Clearly, the author is more capable in this task, but the point is to intellectually exercise and understand how research develops.  
5. Write up your experience with these sources following the categorized bibliography. What don't you know? Did the sources lead you to others along the web of signifiers?  

As with previous assignments, use prose with paragraphs for everything except the categorized bibliography itself. Use quotes are part of explaining your own experience with the sources you chose. Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs. Continue to use the same citation style and formatting we've used thus far, including on your bibliography.
