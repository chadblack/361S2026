# Benchmark Assignment 1: Capital. Nation. State.

**DUE:** **February 15th**

Historians largely operate through texts, be they the textual remains of the past preserved in archives, contemporary theory, or the historiographic development of works written over time by other historians. Each of these types of texts, and in many other forms, require thoughtful strategies to place ideas, theories, facts, contexts, etc in relation to one another. This is often the first step into "historical thinking," and thus a skill that must be learned and cultivated like any other skill -- through repetition. This repetition is built in to history classes, but also asks students to be [active participants in both reading and discussion](https://chadblack.net/2023SPORT/resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/). 

In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can figure out what is important in a set of readings, and then communicate through your own summary what that is and why. 

Chose one chapter or article from the semester up to this point and summarize it using [the form of a précis and memo](https://chadblack.net/2023SPORT/resources/how%20to%20write%20a%20precis%20and%20memo/). At the end of the paper, explain a contemporary example of the theoretical description from the piece. In other words, provide your own example of the operation of time, space, capital, nation, state, etc. and explain how it exemplifies the author's argument. You are aiming for the most-important aspect of the chapter, and in the memo section you must utilize evidence from the text to illustrate your point. **Do not include any additional resources or references. If you use them and cite them, you'll get a Fail. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism!** Read and re-read one chapter or article, mark it up, take notes, and then write you paper.
