### About

Why did the world divide into nation-states and colonial territories beginning in the late 18th-century? The nation-state as a social formation is quite young, but claims for itself deep roots that give it an appearance beyond history, even as it claims history. This class will examine a series of case studies from Latin America to examine the history of this spatial and temporal innovation of capitalist modernity. 

### Course Objectives

1.  To introduce students to the forces, events, and conflicts that defined the process by which Latin American nation-states were created and positioned in the global economy.
2.  To understand and use a variety of sources that provide the core of historical inquiry.
    -   Primary written sources, and their particular challenges.
    -   Secondary sources, and how to read them critically.
    -   Visual and physical sources of evidence.
    -   The absence of sources— finding lost voices, and reading against the grain.
3.  To be able to identify, understand, and critique historical argument.
    -   Historians follow a lose set of epistemological, theoretical, and evidentiary rules in their attempts to recreate the limited past that is accessible to us through our incomplete archival record. At the college level and beyond, it is your task to learn how to identify an author’s central argument and to evaluate it based on its evidence, sources, logic, and narrative.

### Policies

**Accommodations:** Qualified students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned in to the instructor or teaching assistant at the end of class on the day they are due, unless otherwise arranged by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted without **prior arrangement**, for any reason. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence cell phones during class. Please do not text during class. Cell phones ought to be put away for the duration of our meetings. Laptops are allowed only for tasks related to this class. Distracting uses of technology (social media, surfing, GroupMe chats, etc.) cause problems not only for your own learning, but for those around you. Research shows that analog note-taking improves learning. Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking– both while reading and in class– leads to substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use your laptop for note-taking, I won’t stop you from doing so.

**Plagiarism and Academic Honesty:** All work you turn in must be your own, and not another student’s or produced by AI. Plagiarism occurs whenever one intentionally or unintentionally uses another's work without proper citation. Generative AI has added an addition layer to academic honesty. For this class, they are to be considered out of bounds. Do not submit work produced by or with the assistance of LLMs, for example generative AI such as chatGPT, grok, Gemini, Copilot, Claude, etc. The assignments in this course are designed to teach you how to think and reason like a historian. Writing is thinking. If someone or something else is doing your writing, it’s also doing your thinking. Except that LLMs do not think. They also are not search engines, databases, or indices of the web or human knowledge. They are very sophisticated statistical models that generate sequences of words or phrases that are indifferent to truth. If you use AI, you might get away with it. But if you don't, you will fail the class. 

**Drop In Office Hours:** Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture, discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses. I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
