# Benchmark Assignment 2: The Sporting Pages  

**DUE: March 26**

Historians don't only read and synthesize information. They also, of course, make new analyses of documents, bringing new questions, theories, connections, etc. to bear on the past. Evidence must be evaluated, sorted, analyzed in an ongoing process. In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can do this clearly and in an interesting fashion.

In this assignment, you will practice reading a set of primary sources within the context of the social formation Capital-Nation-State. On Canvas, there is a set of *Mexican Sportsman* newspapers from the period of the porfiriato. The papers were produced by the American Colony in Mexico City, so you will need to consider how that particular group is intentionally or inadvertently articulating some aspect of the notion of national community, the state, and/or capitalism. 

Spend some time reading through a few issues. Who is writing? What type of information is  included in the source? What words, phrases, references do you not know or understand in the source? Circle or highlight them. Read the content, but also beyond the content of the source. Once you've done so, imagine the potential use of such a source in writing a larger essay or book on Mexico in the late 19th century. How might authors utilize the source? Then, write an essay describing the source, its context, and its content. Speculate on what more is needed, more sources, more information, etc. to make sense of the source or to confirm it. Begin your essay with an argument-- an argument for why the source matters. But also, articulate what questions and limitations it forces you to confront in your own knowledge. **Do not include any additional resources or references except those assigned in class. If you use outside resources and cit them, you'll get a zero. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism.**  

* Use prose, with well conceived paragraphs.  
* Between 800-1200 words (include a word count)  
* State an argument in the first sentence of the paper; that's your thesis.  
* Include at least 3 quotes from the sources.  
* Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs.  
*  Use footnotes for the three quotes and for any other idea or paraphrase you're referencing from the text. Footnote quotes immediate. Other information can be noted at the end of its paragraph. Use [The Chicago Manual of Style citation guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).
