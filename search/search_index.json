Nation. State.","text":"<p>DUE: February 15th</p> <p>Historians largely operate through texts, be they the textual remains of the past preserved in archives, contemporary theory, or the historiographic development of works written over time by other historians. Each of these types of texts, and in many other forms, require thoughtful strategies to place ideas, theories, facts, contexts, etc in relation to one another. This is often the first step into \"historical thinking,\" and thus a skill that must be learned and cultivated like any other skill -- through repetition. This repetition is built in to history classes, but also asks students to be active participants in both reading and discussion. </p> <p>In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can figure out what is important in a set of readings, and then communicate through your own summary what that is and why. </p> <p>Chose one chapter or article from the semester up to this point and summarize it using the form of a pr\u00e9cis and memo. At the end of the paper, explain a contemporary example of the theoretical description from the piece. In other words, provide your own example of the operation of time, space, capital, nation, state, etc. and explain how it exemplifies the author's argument. You are aiming for the most-important aspect of the chapter, and in the memo section you must utilize evidence from the text to illustrate your point. Do not include any additional resources or references. If you use them and cite them, you'll get a Fail. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism! Read and re-read one chapter or article, mark it up, take notes, and then write you paper.</p> <p>Use prose, with paragraphs, as if in a traditional essay.  </p> <ul> <li>Include a word count. Your assignment should be between 700 and 1000 words.  </li> <li>Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs.  </li> <li>Information should be presented as a coherent whole.  </li> <li>Include at least 3 quotes that illustrate your point.  </li> <li>Use footnotes for the three quotes and for any other idea or paraphrase you're referencing from the text.

They also, of course, make new analyses of documents, bringing new questions, theories, connections, etc. to bear on the past. Evidence must be evaluated, sorted, analyzed in an ongoing process. In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can do this clearly and in an interesting fashion.</p> <p>In this assignment, you will practice reading a set of primary sources within the context of the social formation Capital-Nation-State. On Canvas, there is a set of Mexican Sportsman newspapers from the period of the porfiriato. The papers were produced by the American Colony in Mexico City, so you will need to consider how that particular group is intentionally or inadvertently articulating some aspect of the notion of national community, the state, and/or capitalism. </p> <p>Spend some time reading through a few issues. Who is writing? What type of information is  included in the source? What words, phrases, references do you not know or understand in the source? Circle or highlight them. Read the content, but also beyond the content of the source. Once you've done so, imagine the potential use of such a source in writing a larger essay or book on Mexico in the late 19th century. How might authors utilize the source? Then, write an essay describing the source, its context, and its content. Speculate on what more is needed, more sources, more information, etc. to make sense of the source or to confirm it. Begin your essay with an argument-- an argument for why the source matters. But also, articulate what questions and limitations it forces you to confront in your own knowledge. Do not include any additional resources or references except those assigned in class. If you use outside resources and cit them, you'll get a zero. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism. </p> <ul> <li>Use prose, with well conceived paragraphs.  </li> <li>Between 800-1200 words (include a word count)  </li> <li>State an argument in the first sentence of the paper; that's your thesis.  </li> <li>Include at least 3 quotes from the sources.  </li> <li>Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs.  </li> <li>Use footnotes for the three quotes and for any other idea or paraphrase you're referencing from the text.

You will take a deep dive into their footnotes/endnotes/citations.</p> <ol> <li>To start, you will write a pr\u00e9cis and research memo for the chapter or article, identifying its primary purpose and overall structure.

You may choose your own categorization-- thematic, temporal, primary/secondary, etc. Explain why you divided the sources up the way that you did. </li> <li>See if you can locate copies of any of the sources. Very old books can often be found on archive.org,  hathitrust.org, or books.google.com. Other books or articles may be in our own library's collections. Primary sources from Spanish or Latin American Archives may be in digital collections of those archives-- it's hard to say. </li> <li>Pick a few of those sources and read through or interact with them.

Late papers will not be accepted without\u00a0prior arrangement, for any reason. This includes technology problems.</p> <p>Cell Phones and Laptops:\u00a0Please silence cell phones during class. Please do not text during class. Cell phones ought to be put away for the duration of our meetings. Laptops are allowed only for tasks related to this class. Distracting uses of technology (social media, surfing, GroupMe chats, etc.) cause problems not only for your own learning, but for those around you. Research shows that analog note-taking improves learning. Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking\u2013 both while reading and in class\u2013 leads to substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use your laptop for note-taking, I won\u2019t stop you from doing so.</p> <p>Plagiarism and Academic Honesty:\u00a0All work you turn in must be your own, and not another student\u2019s or produced by AI. Plagiarism occurs whenever one intentionally or unintentionally uses another's work without proper citation. Generative AI has added an addition layer to academic honesty. For this class, they are to be considered out of bounds. Do not submit work produced by or with the assistance of LLMs, for example generative AI such as chatGPT, grok, Gemini, Copilot, Claude, etc. The assignments in this course are designed to teach you how to think and reason like a historian. Writing is thinking. If someone or something else is doing your writing, it\u2019s also doing your thinking. Except that LLMs do not think. They also are not search engines, databases, or indices of the web or human knowledge. They are very sophisticated statistical models that generate sequences of words or phrases that are indifferent to truth. If you use AI, you might get away with it. But if you don't, you will fail the class. </p> <p>Drop In Office Hours:\u00a0Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture, discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses. I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I will be happy to set up an appointment with you.</p> <p>Changes:\u00a0I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you to our class meetings.

Much of this evidence exists textually-- as archival material, social theory, academic book and journal manuscripts, etc. Some of it exists as material, aural, visual culture. Most of what we work with in class, though, is textual. Historical knowledge is not simply about collecting data, whether that data is story, dates, names, locations, events. Historical knowledge, and by extension understanding, is a synthetic process and an interpretive act. </p> <p>We are going to read a lot in this class. We are going to write a lot in this class. We are going to talk about what we're reading and writing. As simple and predictable as it seems, this structure is still the core of historical work. </p> <p>At the center of all of this is the postulate, writing is thinking. And, both writing and thinking are processes. And if writing is thinking, then what we are doing isn't taking notes, it is making notes. Making notes that help us actively think.</p>"},{"location":"resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/#making-notes","title":"Making Notes","text":"<p>The types of notes we write are predicated on context in which we make them. So, let's divide this into two categories: 1. Readings; 2. In-Class notes.</p>"},{"location":"resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/#readings","title":"Readings","text":"<p>Okay, given all of that, how do you take notes on readings. What is the process? Let's divide this up into a few steps.</p> <ol> <li>Read actively, with a highlighter and/or pen in hand. This is the first form of note-making. </li> </ol> <p>Over the last thirty years or so, researchers have consistently found that reading on paper leads to better comprehension than reading on on screens. In a perfect world, each of you would print out your pdfs and physically mark them up. That is not always realistic. So, if you read on screen you need read on a laptop or tablet. A phone screen is too small to comprehend readings at the paragraph and page level, which is an important part of piecing things together. If you are reading on screen, take advantage of your pdf viewer's ability to highlight passages. On paper, use a highlighter and annotate your thoughts in the margins. Mark sentences that you think are significant for the article-- for identifying its argument and key concepts, categories, and claims at work. Skim when necessary, but stop when you see something worth highlighting.</p> <p>If it helps, imagine ourself in dialogue with the author. Put all of questions or reactions into the notes, annotated by the page or passage that prompted them.</p> <p>Do not cut/paste your highlights into a note file. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Review your annotations. After you finish reading, go back and review your highlights. Do you see patterns? Rephrase the important ones in your own words, but make sure to include the page number and citation with you notes. Synthesize groups of similar highlights into summary notes, but keep track of the citations. Keep individual notes fairly short and focused. </p> </li> <li> <p>Write a pr\u00e9cis and/or research memo based on the notes you've written.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>There is one exception to my warning against transcription-- and that is in processing primary source material in the archive or afterward. This can be even more true when you're working in multiple languages. But, once transcription is done, the same type of note-taking process needs still to be done, if it isn't incorporated into your transcription. </p> <p>Where to keep these notes? This workflow can be completely paper-based. Bring the physical article and your hand-written notes with you to class. It can be completely computer-based. Bring your laptop with the highlighted pdf and your notes. It can be hybrid, with paper copies of the readings and computer notes. Just remember, do not transcribe long sections into your notes!</p> <p>You can use any number of applications to make and keep your notes. Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Microsoft OneNote, and any number of note-specific applications can be effective. They are all most effective when you use consistent file names, so that it's easy to later find what you need. My current favorite is Obsidian, which also allows you to link notes together.^[This website was also written in Obsidian!]</p>"},{"location":"resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/#in-class","title":"In-Class","text":"<p>The rise of PowerPoint and other slide presentation software has changed the lecture, and attendee's experience. And not necessarily for the better. Text heavy slides encourage transcription, and also anxiety over missing out on transcription. But, just as in the section above, transcribing slides (ie, copying verbatim just what is on a slide) does not adequately register the connections in and between lectures in working and longterm memory.</p> <p>Lecture note-making is beneficial in two ways-- 1. the process of note-making; 2. the product of note-making. The first relates to the intake of new information during a lecture, and the second relates to review of notes later. Concentrating on transcribing slides isn't great for either objective. </p> <p>So, during class I would encourage you to take notes actively on paper or in your note-taking software, and to do so in the mindset that you are annotating what we discuss in class. Imagine that you are explaining what I'm saying to someone, or to yourself. Listen for concepts, categories, etc., and write them down as you go. Raise your hand and stop me if you don't understand something or want to clarify that you're on track. Look over the syllabus before class and think about what the focus of the week is, what questions we're working on, what the narrative arc of the semester is. Let that guide you as much as the text on the screen. </p> <p>For exams and essays, if you do this you will have no problem thinking through the prompts because you'll have already been thinking through writing along the way!</p>"},{"location":"resources/bibliography%20of%20latin%20american%20sport%20history/","title":"Bibliography of latin american sport history","text":"<p>Abena, Joseph L.

To build this argument, Nemser draws on Foucault's biopolitical regime and Lefebvre's production of space and territorializing of domination, and divides his analysis into four chapters that move through the colonial period through a succession of material, spatial practices: congregaci\u00f3n (concentration), recogimiento (enclosure), seperaci\u00f3n (segregated districts), and colecci\u00f3n. Nemser does this in order to reorient the social construction of race away from bodily difference and to material space and domination, as a means of overcoming the naturalization of difference as a thing upon which race is projected.</p> <p>That's full of jargon, but it makes sense to me based on a lot of previous readings.
